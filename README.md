Practice applying concepts learned during Hamburger Menu lessons.
1. import the three bar 'hamburger' icon
2. create a nav bar with a menu that at 599px or less (moblie size display):
   - hides the menu and displays the icon
   - hen the icon is clicked, displays the menu vertically over 'main section' content
  
Steps taken to achieve this:
1. Flexbox - change display form row to column
2. Media Query - know when to detect and adjust for a screen size change
3. Click events - these were provided as they were not taught in this section
4. Alternate between display types to show/hide elements of the page
